# BigDataComputing
Repository for releasing Homeworks of the Big Data Computing course, University of Padova, A.Y. 2019/2020

## Template
This template is an example which was used to create the first homework. It solves the Word Count MapReduce algorithm in three different versions.

The problem is solved in class **TemplateHW1**.

## Homework 1
The homework consists of a program which runs in Java and the Spark framework to implement the *Class Count* MapReduce algorithm in different versions: with deterministic partitions and with Spark partitions. The homework was designed to be developed and run on a personal computer.

The homework is solved in class **G09HW1**.

## Homework 2
The homework consists of a program which runs in Java and uses the Spark framework just for some utilies (such as class Vector) to implement the *Maximum Pairwise Distance* algorithm in different versions: exact solution (quadratic on the input size), 2-approximation by taking k random points from the pointset, exact solution by taking k points returned by the *Farthest-First Traversal* algorithm (algorithm which solves the k-center clustering problem). The homework was designed to be developed and run on a personal computer.

The homework is solved in class **G09HW2**.

## Homework 3
The homework consists of a program which runs in Java and the Spark framework to implement the *coreset-based Diversity Maximization* algorithm. The program runs a 2 round MapReduce algorithm which first computes the coreset and then runs the exact algorithm on the coreset. The homework was designed to be developed and run on a personal computer for small datasets and on a cluster for large datasets.

The homework is solved in class **G09HW3**.
